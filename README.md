# CSVupload

CSVupload is a Node.js web application that allows users to upload CSV files, display a list of uploaded files, and view the data in a table on the front end. The application also includes a search box that can search through the data and display only the matching rows.

## Installation
To run the application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, you can follow these steps to install and run the application:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Salonee-Jain/CSVupload.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd CSVupload`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can use the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

To upload a CSV file, click on the "Choose File" button and select the file you want to upload. The file should have a comma (',') as the delimiter.

After the file is uploaded, you will see it listed on the page. Click on the file name to view the data in a table on the front end.

To search through the data, enter a search term in the search box. The search will be performed on all columns, and only the rows that match the search term will be displayed.
